# Covid19-outbreak-prediction

This is my Machine Learning group mini project on Covid19 cases. Basically, the project is about the outbreak prediction of cases for both the year 2020 and 2021.
The Regression models which are applied on both type of datasets(2020 & 2021) are Polynomial, Linear, Decision Tree.
The Classifiers used for accuracy score are AdaBoost and KNeighbors. 
The Visualization part is the important one so, I've tried various libraries for it. These are folium, seaborn, matplotlib, prophet for all the recovered, death and confirmed cases.

The datasets are taken from various sources like kaggle and other sites. There are different datasets which are used for different in this project.
